      <description>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.</description>

      <description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description>

      <description>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him.</description>

      <description>Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, “His eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.</description>

      <description>Nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration unanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and when he reached that untoward conclusion: “As soon as his illustrious eminence, the cardinal, arrives, we will begin,” his voice was drowned in a thunder of hooting.
“Begin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!” shrieked the people. And above all the voices, that of Johannes de Molendino was audible, piercing the uproar like the fife’s derisive serenade: “Commence instantly!</description>

      <title>Chapter I: 什么是数据湖(Data Lake)</title>
      <link>https://wangran0721.github.io/alexwang.github.io/post/chapter-1/</link>

      <description>“数据湖是指使用大型二进制对象或文件这样的自然格式储存数据的系统 。它通常把所有的企业数据统一存储，既包括源系统中的原始副本，也包括转换后的数据，比如那些用于报表, 可视化, 数据分析和机器学习的数据。数据湖可以包括关系数据库的结构化数据(行与列)、半结构化的数据(CSV，日志，XML, JSON)，非结构化数据 (电子邮件、文件、PDF)和 二进制数据(图像、音频、视频)。” &amp;ndash;from:wikipedia
以上定义是由James Dixon 用于与数据仓库做对比而提出的数据湖概念，是不是觉得以上的一大段话过于冗长和教条，我们可以看下aws对于数据湖的定义。“数据湖是一个集中式存储库，允许您以任意规模存储所有结构化和非结构化数据。您可以按原样存储数据（无需先对数据进行结构化处理），并运行不同类型的分析 – 从控制面板和可视化到大数据处理、实时分析和机器学习，以指导做出更好的决策。” &amp;ndash;from:aws   图源aws，数据湖架构   以下待续&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;</description>
